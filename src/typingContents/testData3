Each of Mozilla's JavaScript engines expose a public API 
which application developers can use to integrate JavaScript
into their software. By far, the most common host environment 
for JavaScript is web browsers. Web browsers typically use the 
public API to create host objects responsible for reflecting 
the DOM into JavaScript.
