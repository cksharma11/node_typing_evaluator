Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". 
In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting 
prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally 
similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required 
to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and 
while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in 
these languages (or nearly so).
